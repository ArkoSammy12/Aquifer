# Aquifer

This is a simple Minecraft server-side Fabric mod that makes small modifications to the way farmland blocks can be hydrated, and grass, dirt, or sand blocks can be hydrated to allow sugarcane to be placed on them.

## Farmlands

Farmland blocks can now be hydrated by water blocks below them, in a 2 block radius one block below and around the farmland block.

## Sugarcane

Grass, dirt, or sand blocks that have a block of water or frosted ice directly below them can now have sugarcane placed on them.

## Compatibility 

This mod supports [**Farmer's Delight's**](https://modrinth.com/mods) Rich Soil Farmland blocks to add to them the expanded water block checks.
